## Background
The fundamental idea of normalizing flows also applies to multivariate random variables, and this is where its value is clearly seen - *representing complex high-dimensional distributions*. In this case, a simple multivariate source of noise, for example a standard i.i.d. normal distribution, $X\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I_{D\times D})$, is passed through a vector-valued bijection, $g:\mathbb{R}^D\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^D$, to produce the more complex transformed variable $Y=g(X)$.

Sampling $Y$ is again trivial and involves evaluation of the forward pass of $g$. We can score $Y$ using the multivariate substitution rule of integral calculus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
     \mathbb{E}_{p_X(\cdot)}\left[f(X)\right] &= \int_{\text{supp}(X)}f(\mathbf{x})p_X(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}\\
     &= \int_{\text{supp}(Y)}f(g^{-1}(\mathbf{y}))p_X(g^{-1}(\mathbf{y}))\det\left|\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{d\mathbf{y}}\right|d\mathbf{y}\\
     &= \mathbb{E}_{p_Y(\cdot)}\left[f(g^{-1}(Y))\right],
 \end{aligned}
$$

where $d\mathbf{x}/d\mathbf{y}$ denotes the Jacobian matrix of $g^{-1}(\mathbf{y})$. Equating the last two lines we get,

$$
\begin{aligned}
     \log(p_Y(y)) &= \log(p_X(g^{-1}(y)))+\log\left(\det\left|\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{d\mathbf{y}}\right|\right)\\
     &= \log(p_X(g^{-1}(y)))-\log\left(\det\left|\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{d\mathbf{x}}\right|\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Inituitively, this equation says that the density of $Y$ is equal to the density at the corresponding point in $X$ plus a term that corrects for the warp in volume around an infinitesimally small volume around $Y$ caused by the transformation. For instance, in $2$-dimensions, the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of the determinant of a Jacobian is that it represents the area of a parallelogram with edges defined by the columns of the Jacobian. In $n$-dimensions, the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of the determinant Jacobian is that is represents the hyper-volume of a parallelepiped with $n$ edges defined by the columns of the Jacobian (see a calculus reference such as \[7\] for more details).

Similar to the univariate case, we can compose such bijective transformations to produce even more complex distributions. By an inductive argument, if we have $L$ transforms $g_{(0)}, g_{(1)},\ldots,g_{(L-1)}$, then the log-density of the transformed variable $Y=(g_{(0)}\circ g_{(1)}\circ\cdots\circ g_{(L-1)})(X)$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
     \log(p_Y(y)) &= \log\left(p_X\left(\left(g_{(L-1)}^{-1}\circ\cdots\circ g_{(0)}^{-1}\right)\left(y\right)\right)\right)+\sum^{L-1}_{l=0}\log\left(\left|\frac{dg^{-1}_{(l)}(y_{(l)})}{dy'}\right|\right),
\end{aligned}
$$

where we've defined $y_{(0)}=x$, $y_{(L-1)}=y$ for convenience of notation.

The main challenge is in designing parametrizable multivariate bijections that have closed form expressions for both $g$ and $g^{-1}$, a tractable Jacobian whose calculation scales with $O(D)$ or $O(1)$ rather than $O(D^3)$, and can express a flexible class of functions.

## Multivariate `Bijector`s
:::caution
The examples in this section makes use of `Bijector` classes that are not yet available - they will be added in the `v0.3` release. The concepts are still relevant.
